Linux Kernel's Handling of Ethernet Communication
--------------------------------------------------

The Linux kernel provides robust support for Ethernet communication through a well-defined networking stack. 
This stack follows the OSI model, managing packet transmission, reception, and processing via various kernel subsystems.

**1. Network Interface Handling**
---------------------------------

Ethernet devices in Linux are represented as network interfaces (e.g., eth0, ens33). 
The kernel interacts with these interfaces via:

Network device drivers: Found in /drivers/net/, these drivers handle specific Ethernet chipsets.
The netdev subsystem: Manages network interfaces dynamically, allowing interface creation and removal.
The command ip link show lists all available network interfaces.

**2. Ethernet Packet Handling in the Kernel**
----------------------------------------------

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer): Uses the Linux bridging module (bridge.ko) to switch Ethernet frames.
Layer 3 (Network Layer): Routes packets using the kernelâ€™s IP routing table.
Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Supports TCP/UDP using the sock API.
Packets received by the Network Interface Card (NIC) are processed by IRQ handlers and passed up the stack.

**3. Kernel Modules Supporting Ethernet**
-------------------------------------------

Generic Network Interface Module (net/core/dev.c): Handles the creation and management of network devices.
TCP/IP stack (net/ipv4/, net/ipv6/): Implements IP networking.
Netfilter (net/netfilter/): Manages firewall and NAT functionality via iptables or nftables.

**4. Ethernet Communication with User Space**
-----------------------------------------------

The kernel exposes network interfaces through the /sys/class/net/ directory.
User-space applications use socket() API to send and receive packets.
The ethtool utility provides hardware-specific configurations.
