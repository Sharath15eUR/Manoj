Question-11:
--------------

Observations and Explanation:
----------------------------------

1. Linux machines successfully communicated via a switch after setting IP addresses and ensuring MAC address resolution.
2. ping worked between the machines, confirming proper ARP resolution.
3. traceroute showed a direct path between the machines without any drops, as expected in a LAN setup.
4. The bridge fdb show command displays the MAC addresses learned by the switch, demonstrating its functionality in forwarding frames correctly.
5. The Linux kernel efficiently manages Ethernet communication through its network stack and device drivers, ensuring seamless packet transmission    	and reception.
