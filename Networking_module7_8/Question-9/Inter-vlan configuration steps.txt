Troubleshooting Inter-VLAN communication between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20

Steps to troubleshoot:
-------------------------

1. Verify VLAN configuration:
	command: show vlan brief (on switch)
	Ensure VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are present. If not create them and assign switch ports to VLANs.

2. Enable Inter-VLAN Routing:
	A Router is needed for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 to communicate with each other.
	Configure the router by connecting to switch using trunk port and configure sub interfaces (fa0/1.10 and fa0/1.20)

3. Ensure PC addresses:
	Both in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 ensure that PCs are using correct IP address. If not confgiure them properly.

4. Test the connectivity
	Ping both the PCs with each other to make sure VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are routing.
