Question-5:

Compare and contrast Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E in terms of range, bandwidth, and interference.


While both Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E are based on the 802.11ax standard, their operational bands and use cases differ significantly.

Range:
------
Wi-Fi 6: Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The 2.4 GHz band offers longer range and better wall penetration, making it suitable for broader coverage in homes and offices.

Wi-Fi 6E: Uses the higher 6 GHz band, which has shorter range and limited wall penetration due to its higher frequency. It's best suited for open environments or line-of-sight deployments.

Bandwidth:
----------
Wi-Fi 6: Limited by the existing spectrum, offering fewer wide channels. 160 MHz channels are rare due to channel overlap and regulatory constraints.

Wi-Fi 6E: Provides access to a wide spectrum, allowing multiple 160 MHz or 320 MHz (in future standards) channels, resulting in significantly higher data throughput.

Interference:
-------------
Wi-Fi 6: Shares spectrum with older Wi-Fi devices and various household devices (e.g., microwaves, Bluetooth), leading to potential congestion.

Wi-Fi 6E: Dedicated to newer devices only, ensuring cleaner airwaves and minimal legacy interference, which improves performance and reliability.
