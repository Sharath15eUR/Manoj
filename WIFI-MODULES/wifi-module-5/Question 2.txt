Question-2:
=========
2.Explain the role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6 and how it improves network efficiency.

Answer:
-------
OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is a foundational technology introduced in Wi-Fi 6 that significantly improves network efficiency by allowing multiple devices to transmit and receive data simultaneously within a single Wi-Fi channel.

Efficiency:
-----------
OFDMA breaks down a Wi-Fi channel into multiple smaller sub-channels called Resource Units (RUs). Each RU can carry data for a different device, allowing multiple users to communicate with the access point in parallel, instead of taking turns.

Low Latency:
------------
By enabling concurrent transmissions, OFDMA reduces the time each device waits to access the medium, resulting in faster response times and more stable connections.

Reduced Contention:
-------------------
Traditional Wi-Fi systems operate on a contention-based model, where devices compete for access. OFDMA minimizes this by scheduling transmissions, greatly reducing collisions and backoff times.

Ideal for IoT:
--------------
OFDMA is particularly beneficial for environments with many low-bandwidth devices, such as smart homes and industrial IoT setups, where efficient scheduling and minimal power use are crucial.
