Question-3:

3. Discuss the benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for IoT devices.


	Target Wake Time (TWT) is a power-saving feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) that enables scheduled communication between a client device and the wireless access point. It is especially beneficial in environments with a high number of connected devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

Power Saving:
-------------
->TWT allows devices to agree with the access point on specific times when they will wake up to transmit or receive data. 
->By doing this, devices can remain in a low-power sleep state for longer periods, waking only when necessary. 
->This significantly extends battery life, which is especially critical for IoT devices such as sensors, smart meters, or medical wearables that are often battery-powered and expected to run for months or years without recharging.

Reduced Congestion:
-------------------
Traditional Wi-Fi networks can become congested when many devices attempt to access the medium simultaneously. 
TWT helps by coordinating wake times among devices, thereby staggering their transmissions. 
This reduces simultaneous access attempts, minimizes collisions, and leads to more efficient use of the available bandwidth.

Improved Network Efficiency:
----------------------------
TWT supports scheduled and predictable data exchange, allowing access points to manage network airtime more efficiently.
It ensures that low-priority or infrequent transmissions do not interfere with real-time or high-priority traffic, improving overall throughput and reducing latency.

Enhanced Scalability for IoT Deployments:
-----------------------------------------
In smart environments (e.g., smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare), where hundreds or thousands of IoT nodes might coexist, TWT helps scale the network by preventing excessive wake-ups and random access behavior. This results in a more organized and manageable communication environment.

Support for Scheduled Communication:
------------------------------------
Many IoT devices operate on fixed reporting schedules. TWT aligns well with such patterns, enabling optimized periodic communication. For instance, a smart thermostat can wake up every 10 minutes to send a temperature reading and then go back to sleep, minimizing energy usage.
