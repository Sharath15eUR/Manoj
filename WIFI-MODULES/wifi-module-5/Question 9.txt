Question-9:
==========
9.Explain the concept of Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) and its benefit in mobile environments.


Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) is designed to speed up the handoff process when a client device moves from one access point to another within the same network.

Faster Handoffs:
----------------
802.11r introduces a fast re-authentication protocol that reduces the authentication delay during roaming. This is done by pre-authenticating with nearby access points and reusing encryption keys.

Real-Time Applications:
-----------------------
In latency-sensitive environments like VoIP, gaming, or video conferencing, even brief delays during handoff can cause noticeable glitches. 802.11r ensures a seamless experience without dropped packets or voice interruptions.

Enhanced Mobility:
-------------------
Devices can move throughout a large area (e.g., hospitals, airports, warehouses) without losing connectivity or experiencing lag, making it ideal for mobile workforces and smart devices in motion.
