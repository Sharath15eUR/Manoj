Question-1:
==========

What are the key features of Wi-Fi 6, 6E and 7 and how do they differ from previous standards like Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)?


Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Wi-Fi 6E, and Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) represent major advancements over Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) in terms of speed, efficiency, and capabilities.

Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax):
-------------------

OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access): Enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple devices.

Target Wake Time (TWT): Reduces power consumption in devices by scheduling transmissions.

MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output): Enhanced for both uplink and downlink.

Higher Data Rates: Up to 9.6 Gbps.

Improved efficiency and capacity: Ideal for dense environments.

Wi-Fi 6E:
---------

6 GHz Band Access: Adds 1200 MHz of spectrum, reducing congestion.

More Non-overlapping Channels: Supports more simultaneous users and devices.

Less Interference: Operates in a cleaner frequency space.

Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be):
-------------------

Extremely High Throughput: Up to 46 Gbps.

Multi-Link Operation (MLO): Aggregates links across different bands to improve speed and reliability.

4096-QAM: Increased modulation for higher data rates.

Enhanced Scheduling: Lower latency and jitter for applications like AR/VR and gaming.

Differences from Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac):
------------------------------------

Wi-Fi 5 uses only the 5 GHz band, while Wi-Fi 6 and 7 can use 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz.

Wi-Fi 6/7 support OFDMA and advanced MU-MIMO; Wi-Fi 5 lacks OFDMA.

Wi-Fi 7 offers groundbreaking speed and ultra-low latency features not present in Wi-Fi 5.
