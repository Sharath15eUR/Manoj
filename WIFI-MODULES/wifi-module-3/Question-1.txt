Question-1:
----------

1. What are the different 802.11 PHY layer standards? Compare their characteristics.


The 802.11 family includes standards like 802.11a, b, g, n, ac, ax, etc. 

Each defines the physical (PHY) layer for wireless LANs. 


1. 802.11b:
-----------

Frequency Band: 2.4 GHz.
Modulation: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS).
Maximum Data Rate: 11 Mbps.
Range: Good range, suitable for general home and small business use.
Interference: Susceptible to interference from other 2.4 GHz devices.
Compatibility: Backward compatible with legacy 802.11. 

2. 802.11a:

Frequency Band: 5 GHz.
Modulation: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
Maximum Data Rate: 54 Mbps.
Range: Shorter range than 802.11b/g/n, but better for higher bandwidth applications.
Interference: Less interference from other 2.4 GHz devices.
Compatibility: Not backward compatible with 802.11b/g. 

3. 802.11g:

Frequency Band: 2.4 GHz.
Modulation: OFDM.
Maximum Data Rate: 54 Mbps.
Range: Good range, similar to 802.11b.
Interference: Susceptible to interference from other 2.4 GHz devices.
Compatibility: Backward compatible with 802.11b. 

4. 802.11n:

Frequency Band: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
Modulation: OFDM.
Maximum Data Rate: Up to 600 Mbps (theoretical).
Range: Good range, can use 20, 40 MHz channel widths.
Interference: Less interference than 802.11b/g.
Compatibility: Backward compatible with 802.11a/b/g. 

5. 802.11ac:

Frequency Band: 5 GHz.
Modulation: OFDM.
Maximum Data Rate: Up to 867 Mbps (theoretical).
Range: Shorter range than 802.11n, but better for higher bandwidth applications.
Interference: Less interference than 802.11b/g/n.
Compatibility: Backward compatible with 802.11a/n. 

6. 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6):

Frequency Band: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.
Modulation: OFDM.
Maximum Data Rate: Up to 9.6 Gbps (theoretical).
Range: Good range, can use 20, 40, 80, 80+80, 160 MHz channel widths.
Interference: Less interference than previous standards.
Compatibility: Backward compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac.
