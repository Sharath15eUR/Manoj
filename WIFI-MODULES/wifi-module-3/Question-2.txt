Question-2:

2. What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work?


-> DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) spreads the signal over a wider frequency using a pseudo-random code. 

	-DSSS spreads the signal's bandwidth by multiplying the original data signal with a high-frequency pseudorandom sequence (also known as a spreading code). This creates a signal with a much wider bandwidth than the original data signal. 

-> FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) rapidly switches carrier frequencies. Both reduce interference and improve security in wireless communication.

	-FHSS rapidly switches the carrier frequency between a set of available frequencies in a pseudorandom sequence. Both the transmitter and receiver must use the same pseudorandom sequence to communicate.
