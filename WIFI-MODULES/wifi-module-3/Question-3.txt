Question-3:
===========

3. How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer? Compare different modulation schemes and their performance across various Wi-Fi standards ?

	-> In the PHY layer of Wi-Fi, modulation schemes convert data bits into radio signals, with different schemes offering varying data rates and reliability. 

	-> Higher-order schemes like QAM provide faster speeds but are more susceptible to noise, while simpler schemes like BPSK and QPSK offer robustness at the cost of speed. 

Modulation Techniques:
======================

	Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK): Data is represented by varying the amplitude of the carrier wave. 

	Frequency Shift Keying (FSK): Data is represented by varying the frequency of the carrier wave. 

	Phase Shift Keying (PSK): Data is represented by varying the phase of the carrier wave. 

	Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM): Combines amplitude and phase modulation to encode multiple bits per symbol, enabling higher data rates.
