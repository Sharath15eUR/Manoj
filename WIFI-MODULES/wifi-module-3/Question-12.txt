Question-12:
============

12. How is the data rate calculated? 


-> Data rate refers to the speed at which data is transmitted over a wireless link, typically measured in Mbps (Megabits per second).
-> It depends on multiple PHY layer parameters, including modulation, coding rate, number of spatial streams, and channel bandwidth.

FORMULA:
=======

Data Rate=(Bits per Subcarrier)×(Number of Subcarriers)×(Coding Rate)×(Spatial Streams)÷(Symbol Duration)
