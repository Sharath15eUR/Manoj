Question-8:
===========

8. What is the difference between OFDM and OFDMA? 

-> Both OFDM and OFDMA are digital modulation technologies used in wireless communication systems, particularly in Wi-Fi (802.11) and cellular networks. 
-> While they are related, they serve different purposes in resource allocation and user management.
-> OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) is a single-user technique, while OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is a multi-user extension of OFDM, allowing multiple users to share the same channel resources dynamically. 


OFDM:
=====

Purpose:
--------
A digital modulation technique that divides a single channel into multiple orthogonal subcarriers for data transmission, designed for a single user. 

Use Cases:
----------
Used in areas such as cellular networking, broadcast media, and previous versions of Wi-Fi. 


OFDMA:
======

Purpose:
--------
An extension of OFDM that allows multiple users to utilize the subcarriers simultaneously, enhancing network efficiency and reducing latency, particularly in high-density environments. 

Use Cases:
----------
Used in newer versions of Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6) and 4G/5G LTE to enable simultaneous access to multiple users.
