Question-5:
===========


5. How are frequency bands divided for Wi-Fi? Explain different bands and their channels. 

Wi-Fi operates in three primary frequency bands:

1. 2.4 GHz Band
2. 5 GHz Band
3. 6 GHz Band (introduced with Wi-Fi 6E)

Each band is divided into channels, which are specific frequency ranges used for communication. These channels help prevent interference and allow multiple devices to communicate simultaneously.

2.4 GHz Band:

->Frequency Range: 2.400 – 2.4835 GHz
->Number of Channels: 14 channels (not all are allowed in every country)
->Channel Width: 20 MHz
->Overlapping: Channels are spaced only 5 MHz apart, causing overlapping and interference.
->Non-overlapping Channels: Only 3 non-overlapping channels – 1, 6, and 11 in most countries.

5 GHz Band:

->Frequency Range: 5.150 – 5.825 GHz (varies by region)
->Number of Channels: Up to 25 (varies by country)
->Channel Widths: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz
->Non-overlapping Channels: Many – because channels are spaced farther apart.

6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E and 7):

->Frequency Range: 5.925 – 7.125 GHz (in some regions)
->Number of Channels: Up to 59 new 20 MHz channels
->Channel Widths: Supports up to 160 MHz and even 320 MHz in Wi-Fi 7
-Interference: Minimal, as it’s a new and less crowded band.
