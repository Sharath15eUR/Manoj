Question-11:
============

11. What are the types of PPDU? Explain the PPDU frame format across different Wi-Fi generations. 

-> PPDU (PLCP Protocol Data Unit) is the final PHY layer frame that is transmitted over the air in Wi-Fi communication.
-> It includes the preamble, headers, and MAC frame payload, structured by the PLCP and transmitted by the PMD.
-> Each Wi-Fi generation (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax) defines its own PPDU format to support specific features like higher throughput, MIMO, OFDMA, and more.

Each Wi-Fi generation introduces a new type of PPDU. Here are the main types:


1. Legacy PPDU (802.11a/g)

-> This is the basic OFDM format used for single-user communication with limited modulation schemes (up to 64-QAM).

Preamble: Short Training Field (STF), Long Training Field (LTF), SIGNAL field
Data Field: MAC frame payload

2. HT PPDU (802.11n – High Throughput)

HT PPDU enables MIMO and frame aggregation, offering better throughput and reliability.

Fields:

-Legacy Preamble (for backward compatibility)
-HT-SIG (High Throughput Signal)
-HT-STF (Short Training Field)
-HT-LTFs (Long Training Fields for MIMO)
-Data (MAC frame)

3. VHT PPDU (802.11ac – Very High Throughput)

VHT PPDU adds support for MU-MIMO (downlink) and wider channels (up to 160 MHz), increasing data rates up to 6.9 Gbps.

Fields:

-Legacy Preamble
-VHT-SIG-A and VHT-SIG-B
-VHT-STF, VHT-LTFs
-Data

4. HE PPDU (802.11ax – High Efficiency)

HE PPDUs support OFDMA, UL/DL MU-MIMO, BSS Coloring, and better performance in dense environments.

Types:

-HE SU PPDU (Single User)
-HE MU PPDU (Multi-User, for OFDMA/MU-MIMO)
-HE ER SU PPDU (Extended Range)
-HE TB PPDU (Trigger-Based, uplink OFDMA)

Fields:

-HE-SIG-A, HE-SIG-B
-HE-STF, HE-LTF
-Data
