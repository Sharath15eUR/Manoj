Question-10:
============

10. What are PPDU, PLCP, and PMD in the PHY layer? 

PPDU (Physical Layer Protocol Data Unit):
=========================================

-> This is the final packet format that is transmitted over the wireless medium. 
-> It's the result of the PLCP sublayer adding a preamble and PHY header to the data received from the MAC layer (which is known as the PLCP Service Data Unit or PSDU). 
-> The PPDU includes a preamble for synchronization, a header for PHY-related information, and the actual data payload. 

PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure):
============================================

-> This sublayer acts as a bridge between the MAC layer and the PMD sublayer. 
-> Its primary function is to prepare the data for transmission by adding a preamble and PHY header to the PSDU, creating the PPDU. 
-> The PLCP ensures that the data is formatted correctly for the specific physical layer technology being used (e.g., OFDM, CCK). 

PMD (Physical Medium Dependent):
================================
-> This sublayer is responsible for the physical transmission of the data. 
-> It handles tasks like modulation, coding, and frequency selection to transmit the data over the wireless medium. 
-> The PMD sublayer ensures that the data is transmitted in a way that is compatible with the specific physical medium (e.g., radio frequency).
