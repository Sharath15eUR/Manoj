Question-8
----------

What will happen if we put a wrong passphrase during a 4-Way Handshake?

	->When a client (supplicant) tries to connect to a WPA2-Personal (PSK-based) Wi-Fi network, both the client and access point must derive identical cryptographic keys from a shared passphrase.
	->If the passphrase is incorrect, the process breaks at the cryptographic verification step.


Step-by-Step Breakdown of What Fails:
---------------------------------
	->Incorrect PMK Derivation

	->The client derives the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) from the passphrase and the SSID using the PBKDF2-SHA1 function.

	->If the passphrase is wrong, the output PMK will be wrong.

	->PTK Mismatch

	->During the 4-Way Handshake, the client and AP use the PMK, nonces (ANonce and SNonce), and MAC addresses to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK).

	->Since the client has a wrong PMK, it computes a wrong PTK.

	->MIC Verification Fails

	->The client sends Message 2 of the handshake with a MIC (Message Integrity Code), calculated using its own (wrong) PTK.

	->The AP, using the correct PTK derived from its correct PMK, validates the MIC.

	->The MIC fails verification because the keys are different.

	->This breaks the handshake.

	->Handshake Aborts

	->As a result, the AP discards the handshake and does not proceed to Message 3.

	->The client may retry several times.

	->After multiple failed attempts, the connection attempt is rejected.
