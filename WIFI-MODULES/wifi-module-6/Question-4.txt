Question-4
----------

Why is WEP considered insecure compared to WPA2 or WPA3?

	->WEP is considered insecure compared to WPA2 and WPA3 because it relies on a static encryption key.

	->It which is easily predictable and vulnerable to cracking.

	->WPA2 and WPA3 utilize more robust encryption algorithms like AES and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)

	->By employing dynamic key exchange and stronger encryption methods, making them significantly harder to compromise. 

WEP:
---
	->Uses a static encryption key that remains the same for all transmissions. 
	->Employs the RC4 encryption algorithm, which has known vulnerabilities. 
	->Can be easily cracked by attackers, making it a weak security protocol. 

WPA2:
----
	->Uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption. 
	->Generates dynamic encryption keys for each packet, making it much harder to crack. 
	->Offers stronger security than WEP, but is also vulnerable to certain attacks like KRACK. 

WPA3:
----
	->Employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for encryption. 
	->Uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for key exchange, which is more secure than the 4-way handshake used in WPA2. 
	->Offers significantly improved security compared to WPA2, including protection against KRACK attacks and more robust encryption. 

WEP's static keys and weak encryption made it highly vulnerable, while WPA2 and WPA3 utilize dynamic keys and stronger encryption, offering significantly improved security.
WPA3 builds upon WPA2's security improvements, further enhancing protection against various attacks.
