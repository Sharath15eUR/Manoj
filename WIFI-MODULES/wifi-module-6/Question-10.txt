How does 802.1X enhance security over wireless networks?

02.1X boosts wireless security well beyond WPA2-PSK:
---------------------------------------------------

Key Security Enhancements:
------------------------
Per-User Credentials:

	->Each user logs in with unique credentials (e.g., username/password or certificates).

	->Eliminates shared secrets that are easily leaked.

Dynamic Encryption Keys:

	->PMKs are dynamically generated for each session.

	->Prevents key reuse across users or sessions.

Mutual Authentication:

	->EAP methods like EAP-TLS verify both the user and the authentication server using digital certificates.

	->Prevents rogue APs (Evil Twin attacks).

Certificate-Based Security:

	->In EAP-TLS, clients and servers must present valid certificates.

	->Nearly impossible to spoof.

RADIUS Integration for Policy Enforcement:

	->Access permissions can be customized per user/device.

	->Example: Block IoT devices from accessing internal resources.

Access Logs and Monitoring:

	->Every authentication event is logged.

	->Makes it easier to track who connected, when, and from where.
