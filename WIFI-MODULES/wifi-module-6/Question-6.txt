Question-6
----------

What is the role of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in the 4-way handshake?

	->The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) plays a central role in securing communications in WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) networks during the 4-Way Handshake process.

	->The PMK is a 256-bit key used to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is actually used to encrypt data between the client (supplicant) and the access point (authenticator).

	->In WPA/WPA2-Personal, the PMK is derived from the pre-shared key (PSK) using a function called PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).

	->In WPA/WPA2-Enterprise, the PMK is delivered securely through 802.1X authentication and a RADIUS server.


Role of PMK in 4-Way Handshake:
------------------------------

	->The 4-Way Handshake begins after both the client and access point share the same PMK.

	->Both sides use the PMK and nonces (random numbers) to derive the PTK.

	->Since the PMK is never transmitted over the air, it provides a secure foundation for generating encryption keys.
