Question-9
----------

What problem does 802.1X solve in a network?

	->802.1X addresses unauthorized access to LANs and WLANs by implementing port-based network access control.
	->It ensures only authenticated users/devices can connect, granting access based on authentication and policies, and enabling centralized management with RADIUS servers.
	->This prevents the reliance on weaker security like shared passwords (WPA2-PSK).
	->By verifying user identity and enforcing policies, 802.1X helps prevent unauthorized access and allows for segmentation of users into different VLANs or access levels after authentication. 

Key Problems Solved by 802.1X:
----------------------------

Identity Verification:
	->802.1X verifies the identity of users or devices attempting to connect to the network, ensuring only authorized entities gain access. 

Dynamic Access Control:
	->Access is granted or denied dynamically based on the authenticated identity and defined policies, rather than static access rules. 

Centralized Management:
	->RADIUS servers are used to verify user credentials and enforce access policies, providing a centralized point of control. 

Guest/User Segmentation:
	->After authentication, users can be segmented into different VLANs or access levels, allowing for tailored network access based on their role. 

Why 802.1X is Important:
-----------------------
Enhanced Security:
	->802.1X strengthens network security by preventing unauthorized access and allowing for granular control over network resources. 

Prevention of "Hardware Addition" Attacks:
	->802.1X directly addresses the vulnerability of "Hardware Addition" attacks, where attackers could connect devices to the network without proper authentication. 

Compliance:
	->Many organizations require 802.1X for compliance with security standards and regulations. 

By implementing 802.1X, organizations can significantly improve their network security and control access to sensitive resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
