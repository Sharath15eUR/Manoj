Question-7:
==========

If WLC is deployed in WAN which AP mode is best for local network and why?

For a local network with a WLC deployed over a WAN, FlexConnect mode is the best AP mode because it allows APs to continue functioning even if they lose connectivity with the WLC, ensuring wireless services remain operational in remote locations. 


FlexConnect Mode:
------------------

	1. Local Switching: 
	FlexConnect allows APs to locally switch traffic between a VLAN and SSID when the 	CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC is down. 

	2. WAN Bandwidth Optimization: 
	This mode is ideal for branch offices with limited WAN bandwidth, as it avoids 	tunneling all client traffic over the WAN link. 

	3. Continued Functionality: 
	Even if the WAN link to the WLC fails, the APs can continue to provide wireless 	services to local clients. 

	4. Egress at AP LAN Port: 
	FlexConnect can be configured to egress traffic at the 	AP's LAN port, further 	optimizing WAN usage.
