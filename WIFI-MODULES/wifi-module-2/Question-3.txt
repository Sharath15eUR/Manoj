Question-3:

OSI MODEL FIT IN:

CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) primarily operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model, using IP addresses for communication between the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and Access Points (APs). 



CAPWAP operates using two tunnels:

1.Control Tunnel:
-----------------

UDP port - UDP 5246

-This tunnel carries control messages, which are used for tasks like AP discovery, joining the WLC, configuration synchronization, and gathering statistics.
-Handles AP discovery, authentication, configuration, and firmware updates.
-Encrypted using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).

2.Data Tunnel:
---------------

UDP port - UDP 5247

-Used for transmitting user data (packets from clients to the network). May or may not be encrypted.
-Can either be centrally forwarded to WLC (Tunnel Mode) or locally switched (FlexConnect Mode).
-Optional Encryption, based on configuration.
