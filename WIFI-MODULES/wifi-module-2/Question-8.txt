Challenges of Deploying Autonomous (Standalone) APs in a Large Network:
======================================================================

Deploying autonomous (standalone) access points (APs) in a large network like universities presents challenges due to the lack of centralized management, leading to difficulties in scalability, configuration, and troubleshooting, as well as potential security issues. 


	-> Complex management and configuration.

	-> Lack of centralized control.

	-> Higher maintenance overhead.

	-> Difficulty in seamless roaming for clients.


1. Scalability and Management Complexity:

Manual Configuration:
====================
	Each autonomous AP needs individual configuration, making it time-consuming and error-	prone to scale up a network.

Lack of Centralized Control:
============================
	There's no single point of management for these APs, making it difficult to monitor, 	update, or troubleshoot the entire network.

Troubleshooting:
================
	Identifying and resolving issues in a large network of autonomous APs can be 	significantly more challenging without a central view of the network's status. 

2. Roaming and Interoperability:

Limited Roaming:
================
	Autonomous APs often lack the intelligence to facilitate smooth roaming between APs, 	potentially leading to dropped connections for users moving between areas. 

Inability to Support Advanced Features:
=======================================
	They may not support features like 802.11r, Layer 3 roaming, or global bandwidth 	management, which are crucial for modern wireless deployments. 


3. Cost and Maintenance:
=======================

Higher Cost:
=============
	The need for individual configuration and management can lead to higher operational 	costs, including labor and training. 

Increased Maintenance:
======================
	Maintaining a large network of autonomous APs can be more demanding, requiring more 	resources and expertise.
