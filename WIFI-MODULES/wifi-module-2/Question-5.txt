Question-5:


CAPWAP tunnel establishment between an Access Point (AP) and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) follows a structured process.

1.Tunnel Initialization (Discovery Phase)

-The AP searches for a WLC using one of the following methods:
	DHCP Option 43 (Receives WLC IP from DHCP server).
	DNS Resolution (CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.local).
	Broadcast or Multicast Discovery (only in Layer 2 mode).
	Preconfigured WLC IP address (manual configuration).
-The AP sends a Discovery Request (CAPWAP packet) to the WLC.
-The WLC replies with a Discovery Response, listing its capabilities.

2.Tunnel Establishment (Join Phase)

-The AP selects the best WLC (if multiple responses are received).
-The AP sends a Join Request to the WLC.
-The WLC verifies the AP using certificates or pre-shared keys.
-If authentication is successful, the WLC responds with a Join Response.
-A Control Tunnel (UDP 5246) is established using DTLS encryption for security.

3.Tunnel Configuration (Configuration & Image Download Phase)

-The WLC checks the AP's firmware version.
-If an update is needed, the WLC pushes new firmware to the AP.
-The WLC sends SSID, VLAN, RF, and security settings to the AP.
-The AP applies the configuration and prepares to accept client connections.

4.Data Transmission (Data Tunnel Establishment Phase)

-A Data Tunnel (UDP 5247) is created between AP and WLC.
-Client devices connect to the AP.
-Data traffic is handled based on network mode:
	Centralized Mode – All data is tunneled to WLC.
	Flex Connect Mode – AP switches local traffic when possible.

5.Tunnel Maintenance (Keep-Alive & Heartbeat Messages)

-The AP sends periodic Keep-Alive messages to the WLC.
-The WLC responds to confirm the tunnel is active.
-If the AP doesn’t receive a response within the timeout period, it assumes WLC failure and starts re-discovery.

6.Tunnel Termination (Disconnection or Failure Handling)

-If the WLC goes offline, the AP:
	Switches to Standalone Mode (if supported) or
	Reboots and re-discovers a new WLC.

If an AP fails, the WLC removes its entry from the database.
