Question-9:
==========

When a Lightweight AP (LWAP) operating in Local Mode loses connection to the WLC (Wireless LAN Controller), it stops serving clients because it depends on the controller for management and traffic forwarding.

1.AP-Controller Connection Loss Detection
=========================================
	-> The AP continuously sends heartbeat messages (CAPWAP Keep-Alive) to the WLC.
	-> If the AP does not receive a response within the timeout period, it considers the WLC down.

2.Client Disconnection:
======================
	->Since Local Mode APs tunnel all traffic to the WLC, they cannot function independently.
	->The AP disconnects all associated clients and stops broadcasting SSIDs.
	->Wireless users lose connectivity until the WLC is restored or an alternative controller is 	available.

3.AP Reboot & Discovery Process:
=================================
	->The AP automatically reboots and tries to find a new WLC.
	->It attempts discovery using:
		Pre-configured WLC IP (if set).
		DHCP Option 43 (if configured).
		DNS Resolution (CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.local).

4.Failover Scenarios:
=====================
	->If a Secondary WLC is Available:
		The AP registers with the backup WLC and resumes normal operation.
	->If No WLC is Found:
		The AP remains in a disconnected state and continuously retries discovery.
-	>No clients can connect until a WLC is restored.
