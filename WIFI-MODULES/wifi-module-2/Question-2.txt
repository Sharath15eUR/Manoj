Question-2:
-----------

what is CAPWAP and explain the flow between AP and controller?

CAPWAP(Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points):
===========================================================
	->It is a standard protocol enabling centralized management of wireless access points (APs) by a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), facilitating communication and control over a secure tunnel.
	->CAPWAP provides a framework for streamlined and enhanced centralized management of wireless networks, allowing administrators to manage multiple APs from a single point. 


FLOW BETWEEN AP AND CONTROLLER:
===============================

In a wireless network with a controller, the flow between the Access Point (AP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) involves the AP discovering and joining the WLC, establishing a secure connection, and then forwarding client traffic through a CAPWAP tunnel. 

	1. Discovery and Join:
AP Discovery:

	The AP, when powered on, initiates a discovery process to find a WLC by sending out 	discovery request messages.
WLC Response:

	The WLC, upon receiving the discovery request, responds with a discovery response, 	allowing the AP to identify and select the WLC to join.

CAPWAP Join Request:

	The AP then sends a CAPWAP join request to the WLC, requesting to join the network.

CAPWAP Join Response:
	The WLC responds with a CAPWAP join response, allowing the AP to join the network and 	become managed by the WLC. 

	2. Secure Connection and Tunneling:

DTLS Protocol:
	After the join, the AP and WLC establish a secure connection using the Datagram 	Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to exchange CAPWAP control and data 	messages. 
CAPWAP Tunnel:
	The CAPWAP protocol is used to create a tunnel between the AP and WLC, allowing the 	AP to forward client traffic to the WLC. 
Encapsulation:
	The AP encapsulates the 802.11 frames received from clients into 802.3 frames (or 	GRE/tunneling) for transport across the network to the WLC. 
Data Plane:
	The WLC then decrypts the data, authenticates the client, and forwards the data to 	the appropriate destination.

	3. Control Plane:

Configuration and Management:
	The WLC manages the AP's configuration, firmware, and control transactions via the 	control plane. 
Data Plane:
	The WLC also manages the data plane, forwarding client traffic to and from the 	network. 
Centralized Management:
	The WLC provides a centralized point for configuration, policy application, and 	management of the wireless network.
