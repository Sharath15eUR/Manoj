8. Describe the Medium Access Control methodologies ?

1. Contention-Based Access (Random Access)

i). Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

Primary usage: Employed in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) networks.

Key steps in CSMA/CA:

-Carrier Sensing: Before transmitting, a station listens to the channel to detect if it’s idle or occupied.
-Idle Channel: If the channel is clear, the station waits for a random backoff period to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous transmissions.
-Busy Channel: If the channel is already in use, the station defers its transmission and tries again later.

Collision Avoidance (instead of detection):

-In contrast to CSMA/CD (Ethernet), where collisions are detected after transmission, CSMA/CA focuses on avoiding collisions proactively using mechanisms like:
   -Interframe Spacing (IFS): Special time gaps between transmissions to manage access priorities (e.g., DIFS for data frames, SIFS for responses).
   -Random Backoff: A random waiting period before retransmitting if the channel was busy.
   -RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send): A handshake procedure that helps devices reserve the channel and avoid hidden node issues.

Clear Channel Assessment (CCA): The process where devices sense the medium to confirm if it’s available for transmission.


2. Contention-Free Access (Scheduled Access)

i). Point Coordination Function (PCF)

PCF allows for scheduled access in a Wi-Fi network where the Access Point (AP) takes on the role of a central coordinator.

Working:

-The AP polls each station one by one, granting them permission to transmit data.
-Collision-Free: As each station is polled individually, there are no transmission conflicts, ensuring smooth data flow.
-Due to its inherent complexity, PCF is rarely used in real-world networks despite being effective at eliminating collisions.

ii). Hybrid Coordination Function Controlled Channel Access (HCCA)

-Part of 802.11e (Wi-Fi Quality of Service - QoS): HCCA enables a more dynamic allocation of the channel, offering guaranteed bandwidth for certain traffic types like voice or video.
-The Hybrid Coordinator (HC) in the AP allocates specific transmission time to devices based on their traffic priority and requirements.
-Ensures quality service for high-priority traffic like voice and video, minimizing delay and maintaining performance.
-Like PCF, HCCA is complex and not as commonly implemented due to its demanding nature.


3. Scheduled Access in Modern Standards

i).Target Wake Time (TWT) – IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)

-Key feature in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): TWT allows the AP and devices to negotiate specific wake-up schedules for efficient communication.
-Collision-Free Communication: By determining when each device will transmit, the AP ensures that there’s no overlap, reducing collisions and contention.
-Devices can enter sleep mode when not transmitting, which is especially beneficial in IoT networks where power consumption is a concern.
-TWT is extremely useful for networks with dense devices like IoT ecosystems or smart environments, where devices have limited energy and need synchronized communication.

ii). OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)

-Introduced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6): OFDMA enhances the efficiency of wireless networks by allowing the AP to divide the available spectrum into Resource Units (RUs), enabling multiple devices to transmit and receive simultaneously.
-Enhanced Spectrum Efficiency: By dividing the channel into subchannels, each device communicates on a distinct RU, maximizing bandwidth use.
-Low Latency: This method reduces the time devices wait to transmit, improving overall network responsiveness and performance.
-High-Density Networks: OFDMA is optimal in environments with many clients, such as stadiums or offices, where traditional methods might struggle.
