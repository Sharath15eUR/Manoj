Question-1:
==========

1. What is the significance of MAC layer and in which position it is placed in the OSI model ?

	-> The MAC (Media Access Control) layer in the OSI model is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2), and it's crucial for controlling access to the physical transmission 	medium and ensuring data is transmitted without collisions. 
	-> It manages the physical addresses (MAC addresses) of network devices and implements protocols for accessing the network. 

Significance of the MAC Layer:
------------------------------
1. Addressing:
==============
The MAC layer utilizes MAC addresses, which are unique hardware identifiers for each network device. These addresses are used to identify the sender and receiver of data frames within a local network. 

2. Access Control:
==================
The MAC layer controls how devices can access the network medium, preventing collisions and ensuring that data is transmitted in an orderly manner. 

3. Frame Delivery:
===============
It's responsible for delivering data frames to the correct destination node on the network. 

4. Media Interface:
================
The MAC layer acts as an interface between the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer (also part of the Data Link Layer) and the physical layer. 

Position in the OSI Model:
--------------------------
Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
============================
The MAC layer resides within the Data Link Layer, which is the second layer in the OSI model.

Sublayer:
=========
It's a sublayer of the Data Link Layer, alongside the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer.
