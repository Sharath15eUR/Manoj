7. Describe the power saving scheme in MAC layer and explore on the types of Power saving mechanisms?

The IEEE 802.11 MAC layer includes power-saving mechanisms to help reduce power consumption, especially for mobile and battery-operated devices like smartphones, tablets, and IoT sensors. The idea is to allow the device (STA) to enter a low-power “doze” state when there is no data to send or receive and wake up periodically to check for buffered data from the AP.

1. Legacy Power Save Mode (PSM)

WORKING:

-STAs switch between awake and doze states.
-AP buffers unicast data for STAs in doze mode.
-AP indicates pending data using a Traffic Indication Map (TIM) in Beacon frames.
-The STA wakes up at Beacon intervals to check the TIM.
-If data is pending, the STA sends a PS-Poll frame to request delivery.

PURPOSE: Simple and effective for low-traffic devices.

LIMITATION: Introduces latency due to polling and beacon waiting.

2. Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD)
Also known as WMM Power Save (Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save).

WORKING:

-Used mainly in VoIP and real-time applications.
-Triggered by the STA sending a data or trigger frame.
-AP responds by sending buffered frames for that STA immediately.

ADVANTAGES:

-Lower latency than legacy PSM.
-More efficient for bursty, real-time traffic.
-Supported in: 802.11e (QoS-enabled devices)

3. Scheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (S-APSD)

-Uses scheduled delivery times agreed between AP and STA.
-STA wakes up at pre-negotiated service periods.
-AP sends buffered data during these times without requiring a trigger.

ADVANTAGES:
-Very efficient for applications that transmit periodically.

4. Target Wake Time (TWT) – Introduced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)

-TWT allows STAs to negotiate specific wake-up times with the AP.

ADVANTAGES:

-Dramatically reduces unnecessary wake-ups.
-Ideal for IoT and smart home devices.
-Enables multi-client coordination to reduce channel contention.
-Long battery life for low-power clients like sensors
