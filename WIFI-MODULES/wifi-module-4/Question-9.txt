============

9. Brief about the Block ACK mechanism and its advantages?

	-> Block Acknowledgement (BA) is a wireless networking mechanism that improves efficiency by consolidating acknowledgments for multiple data packets into a single frame, reducing overhead and increasing throughput. 
	-> It works by allowing a receiver to acknowledge the successful reception of a block of frames with a single Block ACK frame, rather than individual acknowledgements for each frame. 



Advantages of Block ACK:

1. Reduced Overhead:
	By acknowledging multiple frames with one frame, BA significantly reduces the number of control frames exchanged, saving airtime and reducing contention. 
2. Increased Throughput:
	Less overhead translates to more time available for data transmission, leading to higher throughput. 
3. Selective Acknowledgement:
	BA can include information about which frames within the block were successfully received, allowing for more efficient retransmission of lost or damaged data. 
4. Improved Efficiency:
	By consolidating acknowledgments and reducing contention, BA makes more efficient use of the wireless channel, especially in high-traffic scenarios. 
5. Support for QoS:
	The BA mechanism is often used in conjunction with Quality of Service (QoS) standards like IEEE 802.11e, enabling better control and prioritization of traffic.
