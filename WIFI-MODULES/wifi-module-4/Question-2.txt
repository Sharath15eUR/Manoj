Question-2:
===========
2. Describe the frame format of the 802.11 MAC header and explain the purpose of each fields?

The MAC frame generally consists of:

-> MAC Header
-> Frame Body (Payload)
-> Frame Check Sequence (FCS)


MAC Header consists of following fields:

1.Frame Control (2 bytes)

-> Indicates type of frame: data, control, or management.
-> Subfields: version, type, subtype, To DS, From DS, retry, power management, etc.
-> Controls how the frame is processed and interpreted.

2. Duration/ID (2 bytes)

-> Holds the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) duration value or an association ID.
-> Prevents collisions by reserving the medium.

3. Address Fields (6 bytes each)

-> Address 1: Receiver MAC (destination)
-> Address 2: Transmitter MAC (source)
-> Address 3: Used depending on frame type (e.g., BSSID, final destination)
-> Address 4: Only used in WDS (e.g., AP-to-AP communication)

Supports communication across multiple network architectures (like infrastructure and ad hoc).

4. Sequence Control (2 bytes)

-> Includes sequence number and fragment number.
-> Helps in ordering and reassembly of fragmented frames.

5. QoS Control (2 bytes, optional)

-> Used in QoS-enabled frames (e.g., voice/video).
-> Contains Traffic Identifier (TID) and flags.
-> It Prioritizes traffic.

6. HT Control (4 bytes, optional)

-> Introduced in 802.11n and used in later versions.
-> Supports high-throughput features like beamforming feedback.
-> This field Enhances advanced communication features.
