Question-1:

1. In which OSI layer does the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fit?

Wi-Fi operates at both the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. 
The Physical Layer handles radio wave transmission, while the Data Link Layer ensures data communication between devices through MAC addressing.

Physical Layer:
--This layer deals with the physical transmission of data, including the radio frequency (RF) signals used by Wi-Fi. 
Data Link Layer:
--This layer handles the formatting and control of data transmission, including the MAC addresses and frame structures used by Wi-Fi.
