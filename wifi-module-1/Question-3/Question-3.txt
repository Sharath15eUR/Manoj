Question-3:

What is BSS and ESS?

BSS (Basic Service Set):
	->A BSS (Basic Service Set) is a group of wireless devices communicating with each other within a specific network.
	->It consists of wireless devices (like laptops, smartphones) and an optional access point (AP) that they communicate with. 
	->Devices within a BSS share the same radio frequency, modulation scheme, and security settings. 
	->A BSS can be an ad-hoc network (without an AP) or an infrastructure network (with an AP). 
	->A BSS without an AP is called an Independent BSS (IBSS) or ad-hoc network. 
	->A BSS with an AP is an infrastructure network. 
	->Devices in a BSS communicate through the central access point.
	->No communication occurs directly between devices in the same BSS unless via the AP.

ESS(Extended Service Set):
	->An ESS is formed when multiple BSSs are connected together, typically through a distribution system (like a wired network). 
	->This allows wireless devices to roam seamlessly between different BSSs within the same ESS. 
	->An ESS has a single Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the name of the wireless network. 
	->Each BSS within an ESS is identified by its BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier), which is the MAC address of the AP.
