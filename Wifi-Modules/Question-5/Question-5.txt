Question-5:

Difference between Bridge Mode and Repeater Mode

Bridge Mode:
	->Connects two separate networks and allows communication between them.
	->Bridge mode is used for network segmentation.
	->Joins two networks (wired or wireless) to form a larger network without extra routers.
	->More complex setup and network configuration.
Repeater Mode: 
	->Extends the range of an existing Wi-Fi network by repeating the signal.
	->Repeaters are used to eliminate Wi-Fi dead zones.
	->Expands the coverage of an existing Wi-Fi network by boosting and repeating the signal.
	->Simple to set up, often just plugging into the existing Wi-Fi.
