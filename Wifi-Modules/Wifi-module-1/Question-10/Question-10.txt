Question-10:


List down the Wi-Fi topologies and use cases of each one.

1. Infrastructure Mode
	Devices connect to a central access point (AP) that provides network and internet connectivity.
	Use Case: Home and office networks, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and SMBs using a central AP to provide coverage.

2. Ad-Hoc Mode
	Devices connect directly to each other without the need for a central access point.
	Use Case: Temporary file sharing, local gaming, and peer-to-peer communication without an internet connection.

3. Mesh Network
	Multiple access points wirelessly connect with each other to extend coverage and provide redundancy.
	Use Case: Large homes, campuses, and offices needing seamless coverage across multiple rooms or floors.

4. Repeater Mode
	A device extends the Wi-Fi networkâ€™s range by repeating the signal from the main router/AP.
	Use Case: Extending Wi-Fi coverage to areas with weak signals or larger properties.

5. Bridge Mode
	Two networks are connected wirelessly, where one AP bridges the gap between two separate network segments.
	Use Case: Connecting two buildings or distant rooms without laying cables.

6. Client Mode
	A Wi-Fi device connects to a network as a client without providing internet access to other devices.
	Use Case: Connecting devices like printers or PCs to a Wi-Fi network in places where Ethernet cables aren't possible.

7. Point-to-Point (PtP) Mode
	Two access points communicate directly over a wireless link to form a dedicated connection between two points.
	Use Case: Connecting two distant buildings or locations in a campus or business environment.

8. Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP) Mode
	One central access point communicates wirelessly with multiple remote stations or nodes.
	Use Case: Providing internet or network access to several remote locations, like in rural broadband deployment.
