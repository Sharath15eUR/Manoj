Log into your home Routers web interface and check connected device list

I couldn't access my routers web interface(192.168.1.1)

**steps to check the connected devices**
->Open a web browser, type in your router's IP address
->Log in with your router's username and password
->Navigate to the "Connected Devices" or "Device List" section to see a list of currently connected devices on your network.
