NAT(Network Address Translation):
---------------------------------

1. Address Translation (NAT) is a networking technique used to modify the IP addresses in packet headers as 
   they pass through a router.
2. NAT enables multiple devices in a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address.

WORKING:
->A private device sends a request to access the internet.
->The NAT router modifies the source IP (private) to a public IP.
->The server on the internet responds to the public IP.
->The NAT router translates back to the private IP and forwards the response.
