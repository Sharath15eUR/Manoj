Address Resolution Protocol :
--------------------------------
->It is a fundamental network protocol used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address) within a local network. 
->ARP ensures that IP packets can be delivered correctly to the destination host.

Use of ARP:
------------

ARP helps resolve the IP-to-MAC mapping, ensuring that packets reach the correct device.
When a device communicates with a different subnet, the packet must go through a default gateway (router). 
The sender must first determine the MAC address of the router using ARP before forwarding the packet.


Use of Sender’s IP in ARP:
--------------------------
In the ARP protocol, the sender's IP address is used for:
1.Identifying the Source

->The sender’s IP address in an ARP request helps the receiver know who is asking for a MAC address.

2. Updating ARP Cache
->When an ARP reply is received, the sender’s IP and MAC are stored in the receiver’s ARP table.

3.Preventing Duplicate IPs
->ARP replies allow devices to detect conflicts if another device already has the same IP.

4.Facilitating Two-Way Communication
->Once the MAC address is resolved using the sender’s IP, data packets can be sent back to the sender.
