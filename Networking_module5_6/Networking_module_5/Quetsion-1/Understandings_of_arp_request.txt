Module 5
Question 1:

1. Created a simple network in GNS3 with two VPCs and a switch.
2. Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks to the VPCs.
3. Generated an ARP request by executing the ping command from VPC1 to VPC2.
4. Captured the ARP request and response in Wireshark.
5. After completing the above steps, checked the ARP table of VPC1 using the show arp command, which 
   displayed the MAC address of VPC2.

Understanding:
->When VPC1 pings VPC2, an ARP request is sent to VPC2, asking for the mac address that corresponds to the requested ip address
->The ARP request is broadcasted to all devices in the network, but the response is unicasted.
->The corresponding MAC address of the requested device (VPC2) is then stored in the ARP cache table
